# Google Search Clone


## Description

Students are to work in pairs or trios and attempt to re-create Google's search results page in HTML and CSS.

e.g. https://www.google.com/#q=time

You should attempt to recreate the header, footer, _Goooooogle_ paginator, and related searches section.

Please note that we are generating an static page. Just place text and/or pictures were they would simulate your results.

Bonus points for:
* not using screenshots and `img` tags
  * Anything that Google treats as an image can be recreated with an image. Everything else should be coded.
* working links
* HTML5 semantic elements
* W3C validated HTML and CSS
