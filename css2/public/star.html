        <p>This star emoji is positioned <em>absolutely</em>.</p>
        <p>Absolute positioning would typically be, well, <em>absolute</em>, but since this box is non-static-cally positioned (<code>position: relative</code>), the star's coordinate system is anchored to this box.</p>
        <p>Toggle this box's <code>position</code> in DevTools to see the star shift from being in the top-right of this box to the top-right of the entire page.</p>
