## Group Debrief Session
-----

## Objective

Each student should be able to **provide** practical feedback as well ​as​ **receive** constructive criticism after ​working​ with other individuals in a group coding activity.

##Description

After group coding sessions, you will be given index cards for each member ​in​ your group. You will be asked to write one positive action or quality a member displayed throughout the session and one area each member needs to improve on.

We believe receiving constructive criticism is part of the agile methodology we follow at Wyncode. This session will allow members to identify areas of improvement that they can focus on developing to grow as better developers and professionals.

## The Exchange

After you have completed writing the feedback for each member of your group, you will be asked to do the following steps:

* Get together as a group and exchange each ​other's index cards ( You should expect to receive cards from each one of your group members)

* As a group, you will then have 10 minutes to discuss each ​other's​ feedback

* Once your team has finished discussing the feedback, each member will then have  10 minutes to log the feedback within the [Group Debrief Session Spread Sheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wyncode.co/spreadsheets/d/1SHGoB4BaL_b2vyzhabeo-dwaozAFe4OqY9Hs6x6WbME/edit?usp=sharing) for future reference and accountability.
