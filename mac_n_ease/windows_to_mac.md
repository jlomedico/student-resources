# Mac Tips for Former Windows Users

## Desktop
Mac and Windows both have desktops. The "desktop" is just a directory whose contents (files & directories) is displayed is the background at all times.

### Icon placement
- Windows: upper left expands to bottom right
- Mac: upper right expands to bottom left

## Taskbar vs. Dock
- Windows has a Taskbar along the bottom. Mac has a Dock.
- The Mac Dock typically comes with some system tools docked by default, like Finder, System Preferences, Siri, Launchpad, App Store, etc.
- You can mount the dock to the left or right side of the screen in the "System Preferences" -> "Dock"
- If you want to "dock" a new app, drag its icon from the Finder `Applications` folder onto your Dock.
  
## Control Panel (Windows) -> System Preferences (Mac)

## Mac Finder vs. Windows Explorer
- Open the Finder by clicking on the "Mac face" icon in the icon bar or by clicking the "Macintosh HD" icon on your desktop.
  - Don't have a "Macintosh HD" icon on your desktop? Open Finder, then click on menu "Finder" -> "Preferences" (or `Command`+`,`), and check the appropriate box under "Show these items on the desktop".
- `Command` + `Up` to go to parent folder.
- Drag folders into "Favorites" (e.g. your home, the `Wyncode` folder, etc.).

## Installing Programs
- Windows: Download and double-click on an `.exe` file and click through the "wizard". App files are dropped all over your hard drive and registry.
- Mac: Download and double-click on a `.dmg` file. This will "unzip" the file and "mount" it (like an external USB drive). You can still run the app from this "device", but the app is installed only when its icon has been dragged into your `Applications` folder.
  
## Uninstalling Programs
- Windows: Control Panel -> Add/Remove Programs.
- Mac: Drag the app icon from `Applications` into the trash.

## App Windows
### App Menu
- Windows: The menu for an app is attached to its window.
- Mac: The menu for an app is located at the top of the screen.

### Resizing
Same as Windows, just drag the edges out.

### Buttons
- Windows: max, min, and close are located in the upper right.
- Mac: max, min, and close are located in the upper left.

#### "Mac"simizing
On Mac, the maximize button goes full-screen in another "Space" (similar to a Windows "Virtual Desktop"). You can 3/4-finger swipe left and right to switch between "Spaces". 3/4-finger swipe up to see all your "Spaces".

## Keyboard
- Windows: Use `Ctrl` plus other keys to do stuff. (`Ctrl`+`c` = copy, `Ctrl`+`x` = cut, `Ctrl` + `v` = paste).
- Mac: Use `Command` plus other keys to do most of the same stuff (except it's still `control` + `c` for stopping a program in Terminal).

## Trackpad
- Windows: Trackpads have both right and left click buttons (or regions) along the bottom.
- Mac: Never bought into right-click, neither in mice nor trackpads. So to "secondary click" you can:
  - 2-finger click
    - "System Preferences" -> "Trackpad" allows you to configure it to either of the bottom corners as well.
  - click-and-hold
  - Sometimes 2-finger click and click-and-hold do different things, depending on the context.

## Crashing Apps
- Windows: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Delete` to display "Security Menu" buttons, including one to launch the Task Manager, which can be used "Stop" processes.
- Mac
  - Long-click on the crashed app's icon in Dock and click "Force Quit"
  - Click to focus on the app and hold `Command` + `Option` + `Shift` + `Esc` to force-quit it. (But don't do it to your browser right now!)
  - `Command` + `Option` + `Esc` to see a list of running applications that you can force-quit.
  - "Apple Menu" -> "Force Quit"

## Windows "Task Manager" -> Mac "Activity Monitor"
