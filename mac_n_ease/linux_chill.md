# LINUX FUN TIPS

Most of these work for all flavors of Linux unless otherwise noted.

## General Navigating
* `ctrl + c`: Copy a text
* `ctrl + v`: Paste a text
* `alt + tab`: switch between open windows to the right
* `alt + shift + tab`: switch between open windows to the left
* `super (or win key)`: Opens the launcher (Note: This only works for Ubuntu  16.04 or any that uses Unity)

## Terminal

* `ctrl + alt + t`:  Launches a new terminal window
  * (while in terminal) `ctrl + shift + t`: Creates a new terminal tab
  * `ctrl + shift + c`: Copy a text within the terminal
  * `ctrl + shift + v`: Paste a text within the terminal

  To switch between tabs depends on your computer. Watch the screencast if you want to learn how to change the shortcuts.

## Trackpad

Like the Mac, the trackpad has some neat abilities.

* one tap: serves as a click
* double tap and hold: allows to drag folders, files, windows, etc...
* two finger tap: this works as a secondary or right click.
* two finger scroll: allows to scroll windows

These are the most common, your system might allow for more. Also, these might not work on all hardware.

## Ubuntu Workspaces

If you'd like to have multiple desktops like the Windows and Mac users, you're in luck! Ubuntu has workspaces which is a similar feature. You only get 4 but if _really wanted more_ you can google your way to success. Watch the screencast to learn how to enable workspaces.

On the Dash, click the launcher (that's usually the first icon with the Ubuntu logo on it), and search for 'appearance'.
Open that and click on the tab that reads 'behavior'. From there, check the box that enables workspaces. That's it!

* `ctrl + alt + arrow keys`: switch between horizontal or vertical workspaces.

### Ubuntu 17.10 Users!!
Your UI is different from previous versions, workspaces is no longer something you enable, it already exists! You can click on the 'Activites' at the top left to get to the overview or use the shortcut keys to get to the overview. You can drag open windows to new workspaces.
