### Week 7 One-on-One(Intermediate)

This is the scaffolded version of the week 7 one-on-one for intermediate students, the first four steps of the one-on-one have already been completed. Students should review the first 4 steps, but complete the remaining. This adjustment was made to improve time constraints.
