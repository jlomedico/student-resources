# Remediation for JavaScript and JQuery (One on One):

## Alotted Time
30 minutes.

## Problem 1

Create a folder named human_js. Inside of that folder add an `index.html` file and a `human.js` file. Properly require the `human.js` file so that it loads when you open `index.html` in the browser. 

## Problem 2

Using ES 5 create a new object literal(what you think of as a class in ruby) named `human`. A `human` should have a `firstName`, `lastName`, and `Birthday`. 

Open your `index.html`  in the browser and create new human object. 

## Problem 3
In your `human.js` file, create a function named first name, that when called on the human object logs to the console there full name 

## Problem 4

Add the following to your `index.html` file: 

```html 
<h2 id="first">Hey make me fade out after 5 seconds</h2>
<h3 class="second">Make me turn red when clicked</h3>
```

Require the JQuery CDN

```html 
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Write the proper code in your `human.js` file that will make the `<h2>` tag fade out 5 seconds after the page loads, and turns the `<h3>` tag red after it's clicked.
