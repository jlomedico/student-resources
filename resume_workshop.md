**Lesson Resume:** 

Engage: Intro+ Agenda: 5 Minutes 
*Have power point up and ensure all students have been prepared to have their resume present on their screen but not to be worked on. Have them half close computer, so when time comes resume is already on their screen to edit. 

Script: 
*The focus of this workshop is your resume. The reason why we do this is because you all have unique backgrounds that add value to your personal brand. Since you all will be graduating from the same program there are two aspects that arise when formatting your resume (1) How to explain your technical experience (2) How to set yourself apart from others.* 

**Set Agenda:** 
Now, we are all in this together. So the way we will conduct the next 50 minutes will be as follows:
   - Review of Resume’s (Which is better? Why?)  15 min
   - Identify 3-4 important parts of a resume  
   - Edit  your Resume Session 20 min 
   - Individual Activity (timer)
   - Resume Exchange 10 minutes
   - Partner Up 
   - Final Edit Work Time. 10 minutes 

**Explore: Review of Resume’s Which is Better? Why?**
*Alligator (half close) lap tops to ensure full engagement and discourse in the class. 

Students will engage in 3-4 slide’s that have resume examples of which is better. They will be probed to identify the differences in which resume is better and why. Each slide will focus on 1 main point/ objective as to why one is better than the other. Teacher/lecturer will write the main points on white board as students identify them. 

   -Slide 1 Be able to quantify everything 
   -Slide 2 Action Verbs 
   -Slide 3 One Liners + Formating 
   -Slide 4 Technical Resume
This last side is trick question like, it is important to point out that A is better but that B is good and has the github link. 

Important that lecturer internalizes what is supposed to be pulled from each slide in order to manage/direct the conversation to the objectives they should be discovering. 

Use talk moves to help gauge discussion: 
  	- “Add On to that thought”
   -“I hear you saying _____”
   -	“Can I hear more about this____”
   -	“What is the objective of_____”
   -	“What is trying to be portrayed_____”
   - “What is the difference between Line ____ and Line_____”

**Explain: Edit Your Resume!** 
*Set Timer on the Screen for 20 minutes 
Students will now have 20 minutes to review and edit their resumes. 

*Framing:* 
At this time we are now going to open our resumes and begin editing. There is a timer of 20 minutes. The reason why is because we are going to focus together as a class on this one task. We are practicing the focus management here. Your only task will be to edit your resume in the way that we discussed our objectives. There will be encouraged space to not talk at this time but just focus on your work. You will then have time to exchange your resume with your partner when the timer is over, and at that time you will be able to receive feedback and exchange ideas. 

Wyncode Insert- Standard description given to all about Wyncode with lines that acknowledge where their project should be placed. 

*Set 20 minutes on timer. Encourage focus managment, walk around for questions, encourage students to not discuss with other* *because there is a space after this session provided for verbal exchange of thought/edits/opinions.* 



**Elaborate: Resume Exchange** 
*Set Timer 10 minutes / 10 minutes 
Okay the time has come that you will partner up! And exchange your resume with the person next to you. This person will review your resume and have 10 minutes to give you feedback or ask questions. There will be a timer that will guide you to know what to switch and I will be walking around for help. 

Reasons why we do the exchange: fresh eyes on resume always helpful, ask questions! Helps students reflect on what they have put on their resume and why, constant feedback, learn more about each other. 


**Evaluate** 
Once you are done reviewing your partner's work and you’ve been given feedback there is a last 10 minute focus push for editing of your resume. By the end of the 10 minutes you should have made progress on reviewing/editing your resume and at least 95% of the way done to print it out tomorrow for an interview.
