# Property Manager ERD

Your client wants an app where landlords can manage their properties. Team up with a fellow Wyncoder to build it.

## User Stories

- **As a** landlord,
- **I want to** see all of my properties, and
- **I want to** see see any repairs that need to be done on each of those properties
- **So that** I can stay on top of the maintenance of all of my properties.

## Instructions

Together with a teamate, use a sheet of paper, a white board, or an app such as [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to:
- determine what models are going to be necessary
- design and draw an ERD for these models
- and take turns explaining the ERD to each other, justifying why you arrived at that data model.
